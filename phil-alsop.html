    <h1>Of Patterns and Power: Web Standards Then & Now</h1>

      <p>IN <a href='http://v3.danielmall.com/articles/content-display-patterns/'>
        “CONTENT Display Patterns”</a> (which all front-end folk should read),
      Dan Mall points to a truth not unlike the one
      <a href='https://24ways.org/2015/putting-my-patterns-through-their-paces/Ethan'>
      Marcotte shared last month</a> on 24 ways. It is a truth as old as
      standards-based design:Construct your markup to properly support your
      content (not your design).
      </p>

      <p>Modular/<a href='http://bradfrost.com/blog/post/atomic-web-design/'>
        atomic design</a> doesn’t change this truth, it just reinforces
        its wisdom. <a href='https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/'>
        Flexbox</a> and <a href='https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/'>
        grid layout</a> don’t change this truth, they just
        make it easier to do it better. <a href='https://html5forwebdesigners.com/design/index.html'>
        HTML5</a> doesn’t change this truth, it
        just reminds us that the separation of structure from style came into
        existence for a reason. A reason that hasn’t changed. A reason that
        cannot change, because it is the core truth of the web, and is
        inextricably bound up with the promise of this medium.</p>

      <p>Separating structure from style and behavior was the web standards
        movement’s prime revelation, and each generation of web designers
        discovers it anew. This separation is what makes our content as
        backward-compatible as it is forward-compatible (or
        <a href='http://futurefriendlyweb.com/'>“future-friendly,”</a>
        if you prefer). It’s the key to re-use. The key to accessibility.
        The key to the new kinds of CMS systems we’re just beginning to dream
        up. It’s what makes our content as accessible to an ancient device as
        it will be to an unimagined future one.</p>

        <p>Every time a leader in our field discovers, as if for the first
          time, the genius of this separation between style, presentation, and
          behavior, she is validating the brilliance of web forbears like
          <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Berners-Lee'>Tim Berners-Lee,</a>
          <a href='#'>Håkon Wium Lie, and Bert Bos.</a></p>

        <p>Every time a Dan or an Ethan (or a Sara or a Lea) writes a beautiful
          and insightful article like the two cited above, they are telling new
          web designers, and reminding experienced ones, that this separation of
          powers matters.</p>

        <p>And they are plunging a stake into the increasingly slippery ground
          beneath us.</p>

        <p>Why is it slippery? Because too many developers and designers in our
          amnesiac community have begun to believe and share bad ideas — ideas,
          like CSS isn’t needed, HTML isn’t needed, progressive enhancement is
          old-fashioned and unnecessary, and so on. Ideas that, if followed,
          will turn the web back what it was becoming in the late 1990s: a
          wasteland of walled gardens that said no to more people than they
          welcomed. Let that never be so. We have the power.</p>

        <p>As Maimonides, were he alive today, would tell us: he who excludes a
          single user destroys a universe. Web standards now and forever.</p>
